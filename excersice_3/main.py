    the algorithm is really simple
    you can reach any point using three cases
    1) you only jump forward and get to the point in this case it takes k jumps
    2) you only jump forward and get to the point + 1, so you jump backward and get to the point, in this case it takes k + 1 jumps
    3) you can reach any point between sum(k) - 2 and sum(k-1) + 1, making a backward jump in the k jumps
    for example: 
        target_point = 7
        k = 3 you get to 6
        k = 4 you get to 10
        if you jump backwards on the second jump for k = 4 you get 7
